### Docker based solution

We run on Kubernetes now, but in the first phase of the project a Docker based solution was developed. Please visit Contrasec's [GitHub](https://github.com/contrasec-fi/Odala-rbac) to see that version.

That version also outlines some general principles of access control, which at the time of writing are under update, dues to decision to go with Keycloak / APISX / Kong based solution.
